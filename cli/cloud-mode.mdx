Cloud mode connects your CLI agent to the CatOps Cloud dashboard, enabling:
- Web dashboard with metrics history
- Telegram and email alerts
- AI-powered server analysis
- Multi-server monitoring

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Account">
    Sign up at [catops.app](https://catops.app) with email or GitHub.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Token">
    Go to Settings and copy your Agent Token.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect">
    ```bash
    catops auth login YOUR_TOKEN
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Service">
    ```bash
    catops service install
    catops service start
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your server now appears in the Cloud dashboard.

## What Gets Sent

When connected to Cloud, the agent sends:

| Data | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| CPU, memory, disk metrics | Every 10-30s |
| Network traffic | Every 10-30s |
| Process list | Every 30s |
| Service status | Every 60s |

<Info>
  No sensitive data (passwords, keys, file contents) is ever sent.
</Info>

## Check Connection Status

```bash
catops auth info
```

Output:
```
Cloud Mode: enabled
Server ID: abc123
Last sync: 10 seconds ago
```

## Disconnect from Cloud

To disable Cloud mode:

```bash
catops auth logout
catops restart
```

The CLI continues to work locally, but:
- Dashboard won't show this server
- Alerts won't be sent
- AI features won't work
