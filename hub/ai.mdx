description: 'Ask questions about your server in natural language'
---

Hub includes a built-in AI assistant that can analyze your server and answer questions about metrics, containers, alerts, and more.

## Features

- **Server Analysis** - Get insights about current server state
- **Natural Language** - Ask questions like "why is CPU high?"
- **Chat History** - Conversations are saved locally
- **Streaming Responses** - See answers as they're generated

## Quick Prompts

Click any quick prompt to get started:

| Prompt | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Server Analysis | Full overview of current server state |
| CPU Usage | Analyze CPU usage and find heavy processes |
| Memory | Check memory usage and potential leaks |
| Disk Space | Review disk usage across partitions |
| Containers | Show Docker container status |
| Alerts | List active alerts and issues |

## Example Questions

```
Why is CPU usage high?
What's using the most memory?
Are there any issues on this server?
Show me container status
Analyze recent logs
What processes are running?
```

## How It Works

The AI assistant:
1. Collects current server metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
2. Gathers container information if Docker is running
3. Checks active alerts and recent incidents
4. Sends context to OpenAI for analysis
5. Returns actionable insights

## Settings

Access AI settings via the sidebar (admin only):

| Setting | Value |
