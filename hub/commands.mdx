## deactivate

Deactivate the license and free up the activation slot.

2. Sends deactivation request to the license server
3. Removes the local license file

**Use cases:**
- Moving your license to another server
- Before uninstalling Hub
- Troubleshooting license issues

<Warning>
  After deactivation, Hub will redirect to the activation page. You'll need to re-enter a license key to use Hub again.
</Warning>

**Example output:**
```
2024/01/21 12:00:00 License deactivated successfully
```

## PocketBase Commands

Since Hub is built on PocketBase, you can also use PocketBase admin commands:

```bash
# Create admin user manually
catops-hub admin create admin@example.com password123

# Show all available commands
catops-hub --help
```

<Note>
  Most PocketBase commands are not needed for normal Hub operation.
