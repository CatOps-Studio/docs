CatOps Hub can monitor and control your Docker containers directly from the dashboard.

## Requirements

- Docker installed on the server
- CatOps user added to docker group (done automatically by installer)

## What You Can See

For each container:
- **Name and ID**
- **Status** (running, stopped, paused)
- **Image** name and tag
- **CPU usage** (percentage)
- **Memory usage** (MB and percentage)
- **Network I/O** (bytes in/out)
- **Disk I/O** (reads/writes)
- **Uptime**

## Container Actions

Click on any container to:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Start** | Start a stopped container |
| **Stop** | Stop a running container |
| **Restart** | Restart the container |
| **View Logs** | See container output |

<Note>
  Container actions require Admin role.
</Note>

## Viewing Logs

1. Click on a container
2. Click "View Logs"
3. Logs stream in real-time
4. Filter by level (error, warning, info)
5. Search within logs

### Log Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Lines | Number of log lines to fetch |
| Follow | Auto-scroll as new logs appear |

## Docker Compose Support

If you use Docker Compose, Hub shows:
- Compose project name
- All containers in the stack
- Easy start/stop of entire stacks

## Podman Support

Hub also supports Podman containers. Just ensure Podman is running:

```bash
systemctl enable --now podman.socket
```
