CatOps Hub requires a valid license to operate.

## Getting a License

<Steps>
  <Step title="Purchase a plan">
    Go to [catops.app/hub](https://catops.app/hub) and choose your plan (Personal or Pro)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find your license key">
    Go to [catops.app/billing](https://catops.app/billing), open the **Hub** tab, and copy your license key
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Activating Your License

1. Open your Hub dashboard (`http://your-server:8090`)
2. If no license is active, you'll be redirected to `/activate`
3. Paste your license key
4. Click **Activate**

<Info>
  The activation page appears automatically on first start or if your license is deactivated.
</Info>

## Checking License Status

Go to **Settings** in your dashboard to see:
- Current plan (Personal / Pro)
- Data retention period
- Docker container limit

## Moving License to Another Server

To move your license to a different server:

```bash
sudo -u catops /opt/catops/catops-hub deactivate
```

This frees up your activation slot so you can use the same license key on another server.

<Warning>
  After deactivation, Hub will require a new license activation.
</Warning>

## Activation Limits

| Plan | Servers |
|------|---------|
| Personal | 1 |
| Pro | 3 |
