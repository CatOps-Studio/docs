### Via API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/api/license/activate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key": "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY"}'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "License activated successfully"
}
```

## License Storage

The license file is stored at:

| Context | Path |
|---------|------|
| Local development | `~/.catops/.catops-license` |
| Systemd service | `/home/catops/.catops/.catops-license` |

## Checking License Status

### Via Dashboard

Go to **Settings** page to see your current plan and license status.

### Via API

```bash
curl http://localhost:8090/api/license/status
```

```json
{
  "licensed": true,
  "status": "active",
  "activation_id": "abc123",
  "customer": "you@example.com"
}
```

## Deactivating License

To move your license to another server:

```bash
catops-hub deactivate
```

This:
- Notifies the license server
- Frees up your activation slot
- Removes the local license file

<Warning>
  After deactivation, Hub will redirect to the activation page until you enter a new license key.
</Warning>

## Activation Limits

| Plan | Max Activations |
|------|-----------------|
| Personal | 1 server |
| Pro | 3 servers |

If you need more activations, contact support.

  <Accordion title="Activation limit reached">
    - Deactivate from another server first: `catops-hub deactivate`
    - Or contact support to reset activations
