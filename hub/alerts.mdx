## Configuring Thresholds

In Settings → Alerts:

|--------|---------|-------------|
| CPU | 80% | 80-90% |
| Memory | 85% | 80-90% |
| Disk | 90% | 85-95% |

### Alert Delay

Set how long a condition must persist before alerting:
- **Instant**: Alert immediately
- **1 minute**: Must stay high for 1 min
- **5 minutes**: Must stay high for 5 min

Longer delays reduce false alerts from temporary spikes.

- Timestamp
- Type
- Severity
- Resolution status

## Muting Alerts

During maintenance:
1. Go to the server or health check
2. Click "Mute"
3. Choose duration
4. Alerts pause until unmute

## Alert Rules (PRO)

PRO users can create custom rules:

```
IF cpu > 90% FOR 5 minutes
AND memory > 80%
THEN alert telegram
```

## Quiet Hours

Coming soon: Disable alerts during specified hours.
