    B --> E[System Metrics]
    B --> F[Docker API]
    B --> G[Network Stats]
```

2. **Metrics Collection** - Collects system metrics every 10 seconds
3. **Local Storage** - Data stored in embedded PocketBase database
4. **Web Interface** - React dashboard served from the binary
5. **Cleanup Job** - Automatically removes old data based on retention period
