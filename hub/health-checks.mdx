title: Hub Health Checks
description: 'Monitor HTTP endpoints from Hub'
---

Monitor your websites and APIs directly from Hub, without depending on external services.

## Creating a Health Check

1. Go to **Health Checks** in the dashboard
2. Click **Add**
3. Configure:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Name | Display name |
| URL | Full URL to monitor |
| Method | GET, POST, HEAD |
| Interval | Check frequency (seconds) |
| Timeout | Max wait time (seconds) |

4. Click **Create**

## How Checks Work

Every interval, Hub:
1. Sends HTTP request to the URL
2. Records response time and status
3. Marks UP if 2xx status code
4. Marks DOWN if timeout or non-2xx
5. Sends alert on status change

## Expected Status Codes

By default, any 2xx (200-299) is considered healthy.

To accept only specific codes:
- `200` - Only 200 is OK
- `200,201,204` - Accept these specific codes

## Retry Logic

Before alerting, Hub retries failed checks:

| Setting | Default |
|---------|---------|
| Retries | 3 |
| Retry interval | 10s |
| Confirmation delay | 30s |

This prevents false alerts from temporary network issues.

## Alerts

Configure where to send alerts:

1. Go to Settings → Notifications
2. Set up Telegram or email
3. New health check alerts go to configured channels

## Viewing History

Click any health check to see:
- **Uptime percentage** (24h, 7d, 30d)
- **Response time graph**
- **Recent checks** (last 100)
- **Incident history**

## Limits

| Plan | Health Checks |
|------|---------------|
| Personal | 10 |
| PRO | Unlimited |

## Internal vs External URLs

Hub can monitor:
- **External URLs**: Public websites, APIs
- **Internal URLs**: Services on your network (localhost, private IPs)

This is useful for monitoring internal services that aren't publicly accessible.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="All checks show DOWN">
    1. Check Hub has internet access
    2. Verify DNS resolution:
    ```bash
    curl -I https://your-url.com
    ```
    3. Check firewall allows outbound HTTPS
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Intermittent false alerts">
    Increase retry count or confirmation delay in check settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Response times too high">
    Hub measures from server location. High latency is normal for geographically distant services.
