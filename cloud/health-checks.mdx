Health checks monitor your websites and APIs, alerting you when they go down.

## Creating a Health Check

1. Go to **Health Checks** in the dashboard
2. Click **Add Health Check**
3. Fill in the details:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Name | Display name | `Production API` |
| URL | Full URL to check | `https://api.example.com/health` |
| Method | HTTP method | `GET`, `POST`, `HEAD` |
| Interval | Check frequency | `30` (seconds) |
| Timeout | Max response time | `10` (seconds) |

4. Click **Create**

## How It Works

Every interval, we:
1. Send an HTTP request to your URL
2. Record response time and status code
3. Mark as **UP** if status is 2xx, **DOWN** otherwise
4. Send alert if status changes

## Alert Behavior

- **First failure**: Wait and retry
- **Confirmed down**: Send alert after multiple failures
- **Recovery**: Send "back up" notification

<Info>
  We use confirmation checks to avoid false alerts from temporary network issues.

## Expected Status Codes

By default, 2xx responses are considered healthy. You can customize:

| Expected | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `200` | Only 200 is healthy |
| `200,201` | 200 or 201 is healthy |
| `2xx` | Any 200-299 is healthy |

## Keyword Matching

Optionally check that the response contains specific text:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Keyword | Text to find in response |
| Mode | `contains` or `not_contains` |

Example: Check that your API returns `"status":"ok"`.

## Retry Settings

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Retries | Number of retry attempts | `3` |
| Retry Interval | Seconds between retries | `10` |

## Uptime Statistics

For each health check, you'll see:
- **24h Uptime**: Last 24 hours
- **7d Uptime**: Last 7 days
- **30d Uptime**: Last 30 days
- **Response Time**: Average, min, max

## Public Status Pages

<Note>
  Requires PRO plan
</Note>

Share a public status page with your users:

1. Go to the health check settings
2. Enable "Public Status Page"
3. Copy the public URL

Your users can see uptime status without logging in.

## Incidents

When a health check fails, an incident is created:
- Start time
- Error message or status code
- Duration (when recovered)

View incident history in the Health Check details.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What endpoint should I monitor?">
    Create a `/health` endpoint that checks critical dependencies:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "ok",
      "database": "connected",
      "redis": "connected"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often should I check?">
    - **Critical services**: Every 30 seconds
    - **Regular websites**: Every 60 seconds
    - **Non-critical**: Every 5 minutes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What timeout should I use?">
    Set timeout higher than your typical response time. If your API responds in 500ms, use 5-10s timeout.
  </Accordion>
