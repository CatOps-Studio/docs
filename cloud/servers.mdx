## Adding a Server

### Step 1: Get Your Token

Go to [catops.app/settings](https://catops.app/settings) and copy your Agent Token.

### Step 2: Install Agent

Run on your server:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.catops.app/install.sh | bash
```

<Warning>
  Don't use `sudo`. The agent installs to your home directory (`~/.local/bin`).
</Warning>

### Step 3: Connect to Cloud

```bash
catops auth login YOUR_TOKEN
```

### Step 4: Start as Service

```bash
catops service install
catops service start
```

Your server will now appear in the dashboard.

## What Gets Collected

Every 10-30 seconds (configurable), the agent collects:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| CPU | Usage percentage, per-core breakdown |
| Memory | Used, available, cached, swap |
| Disk | Usage per mount, IOPS, throughput |
| Network | Bytes in/out, connections, errors |
| Processes | Top processes by CPU and memory |
| Services | Detected services (nginx, postgres, etc.) |
| Load | 1m, 5m, 15m load averages |

## Changing Collection Interval

```bash
catops set interval 30
catops restart
```

Valid range: 10-300 seconds.

## Multiple Servers

Repeat the install process on each server. They'll all appear in your dashboard.

```bash
# On server 2
curl -fsSL https://get.catops.app/install.sh | bash
catops auth login YOUR_TOKEN
catops service install && catops service start
```

<Info>
  Free tier: up to 3 servers. PRO: unlimited.
</Info>

## Naming Servers

Servers are named by their hostname by default. To change:

1. Go to Settings in the dashboard
2. Find the server
3. Click Edit and set a custom name

## Removing a Server

On the server:

```bash
catops service stop
catops service remove
catops uninstall
```

Then remove it from the dashboard in Settings → Servers.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Server not appearing in dashboard">
    1. Check connection: `catops auth info`
    2. Restart service: `catops restart`
    3. Check logs: `catops service status`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Metrics not updating">
    1. Ensure service is running: `catops service status`
    2. Check network: `curl https://api.catops.app/health`
    3. Restart: `catops restart`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High CPU usage from agent">
    The agent typically uses less than 1% CPU. If higher:
    1. Increase interval: `catops set interval 60`
    2. Restart: `catops restart`
  </Accordion>
